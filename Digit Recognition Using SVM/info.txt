Here i am working on MNIST dataset for recogninzing digits from 0 to 9. First i splitted MNIST dataset into training and testing part. Then i trained my model with the training part and i have acheived an accuarcy of 93.33 percent with testing part.
Additionally i tried to predict my own handwritten digits written on online blackboard and it predicted almost 60 percent correctly.
I am attaching my handwritten picture of digits also.
