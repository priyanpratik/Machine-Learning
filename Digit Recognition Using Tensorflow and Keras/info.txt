Here i am working on MNIST dataset for recogninzing digits from 0 to 9. First i splitted MNIST dataset into training and testing part. Then i trained my model with the training part with around 99 percent accuracy and i have acheived an accuarcy of 97.89 percent with testing part.
Additionally i tried to predict my own handwritten digits written on online blackboard and it predicted almost 80 percent correctly (wrong prediction of 4 & 9).
I am attaching my handwritten picture of digits also.
